The iris flower classification project uses data science techniques to classify Iris flowers into three species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica) based on features like petal and sepal dimensions. It involves data preprocessing, visualization, and applying machine learning algorithms to build an accurate classificationÂ model.
